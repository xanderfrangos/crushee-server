*An image squisher*

Crushee is an image compression tool, accessed through a web browser. It accepts JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG, and WebP files, and will output to JPEG, PNG, or WebP. It's useful for batch optimization and resizing images. You can carefully tune your images to meet your needs without having to re-upload or restart every time.

Crushee was primarily built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/), and [compress-images](https://github.com/semiromid/compress-images).



## Desktop App

For the average user, It's recommended that you use the [desktop app](https://github.com/xanderfrangos/crushee) (available for MacOS and Windows) instead of the server. The app has all of the capabilities of the server, but without needing to run a Node server and remember URLs.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (v10+)

- **libjpeg** (Actual library depends on your OS)

- What what I've experienced, all other image libraries should come pre-built through *npm install*



## Usage

- Download or clone
- Run *npm install*
- If you're missing any image libraries (depending on your OS), get those and re-run *npm install* as needed
- Run *node index.js*
- Access Crushee through port 1603. By default, it listens only on the loopback interface (ex. `http://localhost:1603`). You may change the listening interface by modifying the `CRUSHEE_HOST` environment variable (ex. to listen to all network interfaces, `export CRUSHEE_HOST=0.0.0.0`) and the listening port by modifying either the `CRUSHEE_PORT` or `PORT` environment variable (ex. to listen on 8080/tcp, `export CRUSHEE_PORT=8080`).
